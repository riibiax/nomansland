 Surveillance most usually involves observation of individuals for the purpose of influencing, managing, directing, or protecting. All this data is stored and will live in servers around the world, in many cases without any benefits. In the real world we have rubbish servers and in the virtual world pollution of data. Looking in the databases populated by surveillance cameras, we can see a reflection of our society, more and more a system of images, and the loss of our privacy in the name of security.

"No man's land" is a series of poster collecting images from all public cameras in Switzerland at the same time. These pictures are filtered by algorithms able to detect the human presence. The result is a collage of pictures, a landscape where there is no human presence.
